<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./public/project-overview.png)

My take on devchallenge.io's Todo challenge. I did it as a training project to get more confortable when using React. This one was a bit easier. I learned a lot about React, especially about arrays in the component's state.

I also improved a bit in scss (and css) through this project.
